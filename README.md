# Digital-Multimeter-Using-CPP

Thus Multimeter is very vital part of electronics and electrical field. It measures the most important electrical properties such as voltage, current and resistance. Programming any object in object oriented language like C++ needs a very clear understanding of that object. Hence this project helps to find such minute details of an object by finding out its properties and behaviors. Designing a multimeter in C++ will help learn object oriented language with good understanding.
